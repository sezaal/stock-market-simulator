# stock-market-simulator
INTRODUCTION:
This project is a stock market simulator in python. It stimulates the market by randomising the values based on the news. It simplifies the notion of good news and bad news relating to a company and helps students understand the stock market.

AIM:
The aim of this project is to make students aware about the stock market and its workings. It is designed to explain and show what a simplified stock market looks like. It also helps the students in understanding the core principles of the stock market and what the true market may look like.

IDEA SOURCE:
The source for this idea stems from our interest in stocks. We wanted to create a program that can help introduce students to the world of stocks.

PLAN FOR IMPLEMENTATION:
The game code is ready. We plan on adding a leaderboard functionality for contests. We intend to use a csv file to store and sort them everytime. We are also considering a way for the user to enter their own starting amount and practice with different sums of money.

VALIDATIONS AND ADD ON FEATURES
The stimulator runs for 5 days to represent the 5 working days of a week. It has 8 tradable stocks with daily price lists and news for each. It has an inventory system which is validated so that the person can't sell more stocks than they own. It also has a trade center where the user can purchase and sell stocks. It has a validation system in place so that the user can't spend more money than they have and sell more stocks than they have. It gives the user information about the stocks and their possible price changes and the news matches the change in prices. In the end, it calculates the final amount and profit percentage.
The leaderboard will sort the ranks according to profit percentage and  display top 5 scores.
